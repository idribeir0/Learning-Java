# Java Programming Logic Learning

This repo contains my studies and practice in programming logic using Java. As I learn and practice new concepts, I document my progress here. If you're starting with Java or want to improve your programming skills, this repo may be helpful.

## Introduction
I'm learning the java programming gradually. The goal is to understand the core principles and move on to more complex projects as time and knowledge progress.

## Hello world
The first step was create the traditional hello world program. It helps understand the basic of a program structure in java, including classes and methods.

## Variables
We use variable to store data values that can be referenced and manipulated throughout a program.
Every variable has to have a name, a value and a data type.

## Primitive types
The primitive types are the basic building blocks in java that store simples values, each with a defined size and range.

## Reference types
These are more complex objects that store references to data (such as arrays, classes, and interfaces). Instead of storing the actual data, they store a reference (or pointer) to where the data is located in memory(heap)

## Strings
String is a sequence of characters, used to store and manipulate text. Strings are immutable - once created, their value cannot be changed. But we can manipulate the strings using methods.

## Method
In java a method is a block of code that performs a specific task like a set of instructions grouped together to do something like calculating a sum, printing text or sortin a list.

## Arrays
In java an aray is a data structure that stores a fixed-size collection of elements of the same type. It's like a container that holds multiple values in a single variable.
