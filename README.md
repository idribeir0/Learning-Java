# Java Programming Logic Learning

This repo contains my studies and practice in programming logic using Java. As I learn and practice new concepts, I document my progress here. f you're starting with Java or want to improve your programming skills, this repo may be helpful.

## Introduction
I'm learning the java prograaming gradually. The goal is to understand the core principles and move on to more complex projects as time and knowledge progress.

## Hello world
The first step was create the traditional hello world program. It helps understand the basic of a program structure in java, including classes and methods.

## Variables
We use variable to store data values that can be referenced and manipulated throughout a program.
Every variable has to have a name, a value and a data type.

## Primitive types
The primitive types are the basic building blocks in java that store simples values, each with a defined size and range.

| Primitive Type | Size         | Range/Values                                    |
|----------------|--------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| `byte`         | 1 byte       | -128 to 127                                      |
| `short`        | 2 bytes      | -32,768 to 32,767                               |
| `int`          | 4 bytes      | -2^31 to 2^31 - 1                               |
| `long`         | 8 bytes      | -2^63 to 2^63 - 1                               |
| `float`        | 4 bytes      | ±3.40282347E+38F (6-7 decimal digits)           |
| `double`       | 8 bytes      | ±1.79769313486231570E+308 (15 decimal digits)   |
| `char`         | 2 bytes      | 0 to 65,535 (Unicode characters)                |
| `boolean`      | 1 bit        | `true` or `false`                               |
